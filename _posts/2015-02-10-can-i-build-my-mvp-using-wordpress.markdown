I’ve heard this question several times. What if I just build my startup MVP using Wordpress? It's a simple question, and a tempting idea. As a startup founder, you have to move as fast as possible. If a paper sketch helps you move forward, you should do it. If you can build a click-through mockup in Balsamiq or Keynote, show to potential customers, and sign a deal, that awesome. 

Realistically, most software startups need a software prototype pretty early in their lifecycle. A paper sketch may be useful a few times, a click-through mockup can work for a couple of weeks until you get your feedback. Then you realize that you need more than that. What should it be? That’s when Wordpress comes up as a choice. It’s one of the top platforms for building all sorts of web sites, and has a huge eco-system of design themes, plugins, marketing tutorials, and more. Yet, keep in mind, it’s a content management system (CMS) first, and everything else is second at best. It may serve as a bridge-loan between your mockup and fully functional web application. It will probably serve you for a couple of months.

Yes, it’s possible to use it as a multi-tenant system for thousands of users, but it may easily end up as a disaster similar to Burning Man registration site that goes down for an hour or longer when burners are eager to register, just like it happened today on February 11, 2015. 

There are more problems too. Let’s say for example, you picked a shiny new WP theme, paid $35 for it, and it seemed reasonably good. Then you decided to add a subscribe button that should integrate with Sendgrid. You noticed that your team member profile pictures would look better with round corners. You got lucky, because you got a Sendgrid widget customized to match your theme. You found a great plugin for team members, but it turned out to have an outdated design that did not match your theme. The issues keep piling up, and eventually just like any mature project, it’s a nightmare. 

A web application will have similar problems, but usually if it’s well architectured, it’s much more flexible, and can live for “startup months” (years in big corporations). Here is a chart for deciding what and when you should consider using:

* Paper sketches, a few days of lifespan
* Click-through mockups, a few weeks
* Wordpress (or Joomla/Shopify/etc) - a month or two
* Web app - months between significant revamps
